Director, Folger Shakespeare LibraryIt is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.
Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.
The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.
I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare
LibraryUntil now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.
Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.
The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “If she in chains of magic were not bound,”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, fromTextual Introduction
By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine
Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.
Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.
Macbeth, set primarily in Scotland, mixes witchcraft, prophecy, and
murder. Three “Weïrd Sisters” appear to Macbeth and his comrade
Banquo after a battle and prophesy that Macbeth will be king and
that the descendants of Banquo will also reign. When Macbeth
arrives at his castle, he and Lady Macbeth plot to assassinate King
Duncan, soon to be their guest, so that Macbeth can become king.
After Macbeth murders Duncan, the king’s two sons flee, and
Macbeth is crowned. Fearing that Banquo’s descendants will,
according to the Weïrd Sisters’ predictions, take over the kingdom,
Macbeth has Banquo killed. At a royal banquet that evening,
Macbeth sees Banquo’s ghost appear covered in blood. Macbeth
determines to consult the Weïrd Sisters again. They comfort him
with ambiguous promises.
Another nobleman, Macduff, rides to England to join Duncan’s older
son, Malcolm. Macbeth has Macduff’s wife and children murdered.
Malcolm and Macduff lead an army against Macbeth, as Lady
Macbeth goes mad and commits suicide.
Macbeth confronts Malcolm’s army, trusting in the Weïrd Sisters’
comforting promises. He learns that the promises are tricks, but
continues to fight. Macduff kills Macbeth and Malcolm becomes
Scotland’s king.SynopsisThree Witches, the Weïrd Sisters

Captain.
 
 What bloody man is that? He can report,
 As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
 The newest state.
   This is the sergeant
 Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought
 ’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend!
 Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
 As thou didst leave it.
  Doubtful it stood,
 As two spent swimmers that do cling together
 And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald
 (Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
 The multiplying villainies of nature
 Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles
 Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
 And Fortune, on his damnèd quarrel smiling,
 Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;
 For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),
 Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,
 Which smoked with bloody execution,
 Like Valor’s minion, carved out his passage
 Till he faced the slave;
 Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
 Till he unseamed him from the nave to th’ chops,
 And fixed his head upon our battlements.
 
 O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!
 
 As whence the sun ’gins his reflection
 Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,Scene 2

 come
 Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:
 No sooner justice had, with valor armed,
 Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
 But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
 With furbished arms and new supplies of men,
 Began a fresh assault.
 
 Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and
 Banquo?
 
 Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
 If I say sooth, I must report they were
 As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
 So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
 Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
 Or memorize another Golgotha,
 I cannot tell—
 But I am faint. My gashes cry for help.
 
 So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
 They smack of honor both.—Go, get him surgeons.
Enter Ross and Angus.
 Who comes here?
   The worthy Thane of Ross.
 
 What a haste looks through his eyes!
 So should he look that seems to speak things
 strange.

 Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
 Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
 The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
 Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapped in proof,
 Confronted him with self-comparisons,
 Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,
 Curbing his lavish spirit. And to conclude,
 The victory fell on us.
   Great happiness!
  That now Sweno,
 The Norways’ king, craves composition.
 Nor would we deign him burial of his men
 Till he disbursèd at Saint Colme’s Inch
 Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
 
 No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
 Our bosom interest. Go, pronounce his present
 death,
 And with his former title greet Macbeth.
  I’ll see it done.

 In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day
 He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
 Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
 Strange images of death. As thick as tale
 Came post with post, and every one did bear
 Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,
 And poured them down before him.

 To give thee from our royal master thanks,
 Only to herald thee into his sight,
 Not pay thee.

 Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.

 Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
 And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
 Against the use of nature? Present fears

BANQUO That very frankly he confessed his treasons,
 Implored your Highness’ pardon, and set forth
 A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
 Became him like the leaving it. He died
 As one that had been studied in his death
 To throw away the dearest thing he owed
 As ’twere a careless trifle.
   There’s no art
 To find the mind’s construction in the face.
 He was a gentleman on whom I built
 An absolute trust.
Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.
 O worthiest cousin,
 The sin of my ingratitude even now
 Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before
 That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
 To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
 That the proportion both of thanks and payment
 Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,
 More is thy due than more than all can pay.
 
 The service and the loyalty I owe
 In doing it pays itself. Your Highness’ part
 Is to receive our duties, and our duties
 Are to your throne and state children and servants,
 Which do but what they should by doing everything
 Safe toward your love and honor.
   Welcome hither.
 I have begun to plant thee and will labor
 To make thee full of growing.—Noble Banquo,
 That hast no less deserved nor must be known
 No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
 And hold thee to my heart.

 The harvest is your own.FTLN 0272

 Not unaccompanied invest him only,
 But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
 On all deservers.—From hence to Inverness
 And bind us further to you.

 Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

 And in his commendations I am fed:

LADY MACBETHEnter Macbeth’s Wife, alone, with a letter.
, reading the letter  They met me in the
 day of success, and I have learned by the perfect’st
 report they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
 When I burned in desire to question them further, they
 made themselves air, into which they vanished.
 Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives
 from the King, who all-hailed me “Thane of Cawdor,”
 by which title, before, these Weïrd Sisters saluted me
 and referred me to the coming on of time with “Hail,
 king that shalt be.” This have I thought good to deliver
 thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
 might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant
 of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy
 heart, and farewell.
 Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
 What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;
 It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness
 To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great,
 Art not without ambition, but without
 The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst
 highly,
 That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false
 And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou ’dst have, great
 Glamis,
 That which cries “Thus thou must do,” if thou have
 it,
 And that which rather thou dost fear to do,
 Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,
 That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
 And chastise with the valor of my tongue
 All that impedes thee from the golden round,
 Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
 To have thee crowned withal.Scene 5

 Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so,
 Would have informed for preparation?
 
 So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.
 One of my fellows had the speed of him,
 Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
 Than would make up his message.

 He brings great news. 
 The raven himself is hoarse
 That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
 Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
 That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
 And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
 Of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood.
 Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,
 That no compunctious visitings of nature
 Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
 Th’ effect and it. Come to my woman’s breasts
 And take my milk for gall, you murd’ring ministers,
 Wherever in your sightless substances
 You wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night,
 And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
 That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
 Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
 To cry “Hold, hold!”

DUNCAN   This guest of summer,
 The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
 By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath
 Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
 Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
 Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
 Where they most breed and haunt, I have

 The air is delicate.

  See, see our honored hostess!—
 The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
 Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
 How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains
 And thank us for your trouble.
   All our service,
 In every point twice done and then done double,
 Were poor and single business to contend
 Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
 Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,
 And the late dignities heaped up to them,
 We rest your hermits.
   Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?
 We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
 To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
 And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath helped
 him
 To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
 We are your guest tonight.
   Your servants ever
 Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt
 To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure,
 Still to return your own.

 If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well

 Could trammel up the consequence and catch
 With his surcease success, that but this blow
 Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
 But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
 We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases
 We still have judgment here, that we but teach
 Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
 To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice
 Commends th’ ingredience of our poisoned chalice
 To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:
 First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
 Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
 Who should against his murderer shut the door,
 Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
 Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
 So clear in his great office, that his virtues
 Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
 The deep damnation of his taking-off;
 And pity, like a naked newborn babe
 Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin horsed

 And wakes it now, to look so green and pale

 That made you break this enterprise to me?
 When you durst do it, then you were a man;
 And to be more than what you were, you would
 Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
 Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.
 They have made themselves, and that their fitness

 Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
 How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me.
 I would, while it was smiling in my face,
 Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums
 And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you
 Have done to this.

   We fail?
 But screw your courage to the sticking place
 And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep
 (Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey
 Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains
 Will I with wine and wassail so convince
 That memory, the warder of the brain,
 Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
 A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
 Their drenchèd natures lies as in a death,
 What cannot you and I perform upon
 Th’ unguarded Duncan? What not put upon
 His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
 Of our great quell?
   Bring forth men-children only,
 For thy undaunted mettle should compose
 Nothing but males. Will it not be received,

 Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,

 Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,
 And, on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,
 Which was not so before. There’s no such thing.
 It is the bloody business which informs
 Thus to mine eyes. Now o’er the one-half world
 Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
 The curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates
 Pale Hecate’s off’rings, and withered murder,
 Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,
 Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
 With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his
 design
 Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
 Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
 Thy very stones prate of my whereabouts
 And take the present horror from the time,
 Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives.
 Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
 I go, and it is done. The bell invites me.
 Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell
 That summons thee to heaven or to hell.FTLN 0602 50

 That which hath made them drunk hath made me
 bold.
 What hath quenched them hath given me fire.
 Hark!—Peace.
 It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,
 Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it.
 The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
 Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged
 their possets,
 That death and nature do contend about them
 Whether they live or die.
, within   Who’s there? what, ho!
 
 Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
 And ’tis not done. Th’ attempt and not the deed
 Confounds us. Hark!—I laid their daggers ready;
 He could not miss ’em. Had he not resembled
 My father as he slept, I had done ’t.
Enter Macbeth with bloody daggers.

MACBETH  This is a sorry sight.
 
 A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
 
 There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep, and one cried
 “Murder!”
 That they did wake each other. I stood and heard
 them.
 But they did say their prayers and addressed them
 Again to sleep.
   There are two lodged together.
 
 One cried “God bless us” and “Amen” the other,
 As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands,
 List’ning their fear. I could not say “Amen”
 When they did say “God bless us.”
  Consider it not so deeply.
 
 But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?
 I had most need of blessing, and “Amen”
 Stuck in my throat.
   These deeds must not be thought
 After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
 
 Methought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more!
 Macbeth does murder sleep”—the innocent sleep,
 Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care,
 The death of each day’s life, sore labor’s bath,
 Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,
 Chief nourisher in life’s feast.
   What do you mean?
 
 Still it cried “Sleep no more!” to all the house.
 “Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore
 Cawdor
 Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more.”FTLN 0657

Knock.
Knock. 
 Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
 You do unbend your noble strength to think
 So brainsickly of things. Go get some water
 And wash this filthy witness from your hand.—
 Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
 They must lie there. Go, carry them and smear
 The sleepy grooms with blood.
   I’ll go no more.
 I am afraid to think what I have done.
 Look on ’t again I dare not.
   Infirm of purpose!
 Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
 Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood
 That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
 I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
 For it must seem their guilt.
   Whence is that
 knocking?
 How is ’t with me when every noise appalls me?
 What hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.
 Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood
 Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
 The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
 Making the green one red.
Enter Lady Macbeth.
 
 My hands are of your color, but I shame
 To wear a heart so white.

 himself on th’ expectation of plenty. Come in time!
 Have napkins enough about you; here you’ll sweat

 that could swear in both the scales against either
 scale, who committed treason enough for God’s
 sake yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in,

 there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for
 stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here
 you may roast your goose.  (Knock.) Knock, knock!

 Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed
 That you do lie so late?
  Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second
 cock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three
 things.
  What three things does drink especially
 provoke?
  Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.
 Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes
 the desire, but it takes away the performance.
 Therefore much drink may be said to be an
 equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it
 mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it
 persuades him and disheartens him; makes him
 stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates
 him in a sleep and, giving him the lie, leaves
 him.
  I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
  That it did, sir, i’ th’ very throat on me; but I
 requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too
 strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime,
 yet I made a shift to cast him.
  Is thy master stirring?
Enter Macbeth.
 Our knocking has awaked him. Here he comes.

 It should not stand in thy posterity,
 But that myself should be the root and father
 Of many kings. If there come truth from them

 Why, by the verities on thee made good,
 May they not be my oracles as well,
 And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.

 For a dark hour or twain.

 In England and in Ireland, not confessing
 Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
 With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,
 When therewithal we shall have cause of state
 Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse. Adieu,

Servant exits. Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men
 Our pleasure?
 
 They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
 
 Bring them before us. 
 To be thus is nothing,
 But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
 Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
 Reigns that which would be feared. ’Tis much he
 dares,
 And to that dauntless temper of his mind
 He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
 To act in safety. There is none but he
 Whose being I do fear; and under him
 My genius is rebuked, as it is said
 Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
 When first they put the name of king upon me
 And bade them speak to him. Then, prophet-like,
 They hailed him father to a line of kings.
 Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
 And put a barren scepter in my grip,
 Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,
 No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so,
 For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;
 For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered,
 Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
 Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
 Given to the common enemy of man
 To make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings.
 Rather than so, come fate into the list,
 And champion me to th’ utterance.—Who’s there?
Enter Servant and two Murderers.

 I did so, and went further, which is now
 Our point of second meeting. Do you find
 Your patience so predominant in your nature

 And beggared yours forever?

 How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,
 Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
 Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
 With them they think on? Things without all remedy
 Should be without regard. What’s done is done.
 
 We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
 She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
 Remains in danger of her former tooth.
 But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds
 suffer,
 Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
 In the affliction of these terrible dreams
 That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
 Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
 Than on the torture of the mind to lie
 In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.
 After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.
 Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,
 Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
 Can touch him further.
   Come on, gentle my lord,
 Sleek o’er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial
 Among your guests tonight.
   So shall I, love,
 And so I pray be you. Let your remembrance
 Apply to Banquo; present him eminence
 Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we
 Must lave our honors in these flattering streams
 And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
 Disguising what they are.

 Those that we bury back, our monuments

 If I stand here, I saw him.
   Fie, for shame!
 
 Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,
 Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;
 Ay, and since too, murders have been performed
 Too terrible for the ear. The time has been
 That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
 And there an end. But now they rise again
 With twenty mortal murders on their crowns
 And push us from our stools. This is more strange
 Than such a murder is.
   My worthy lord,
 Your noble friends do lack you.
   I do forget.—
 Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
 I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
 To those that know me. Come, love and health to
 all.
 Then I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine. Fill full.

 And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.

 And all to all.

 There’s not a one of them but in his house
 I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow

 By the worst means the worst. For mine own good,
 All causes shall give way. I am in blood
 Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,

 Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.
 
 Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
 Saucy and overbold, how did you dare
 To trade and traffic with Macbeth
 In riddles and affairs of death,
 And I, the mistress of your charms,
 The close contriver of all harms,
 Was never called to bear my part
 Or show the glory of our art?
 And which is worse, all you have done
 Hath been but for a wayward son,
 Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
 Loves for his own ends, not for you.
 But make amends now. Get you gone,
 And at the pit of Acheron
 Meet me i’ th’ morning. Thither he
 Will come to know his destiny.
 Your vessels and your spells provide,
 Your charms and everything beside.
 I am for th’ air. This night I’ll spend
 Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
 Great business must be wrought ere noon.
 Upon the corner of the moon
 There hangs a vap’rous drop profound.
 I’ll catch it ere it come to ground,
 And that, distilled by magic sleights,
 Shall raise such artificial sprites
 As by the strength of their illusion
 Shall draw him on to his confusion.
 He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
 His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear.Scene 5

 My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
 Which can interpret farther. Only I say
 Things have been strangely borne. The gracious
 Duncan
 Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.
 And the right valiant Banquo walked too late,
 Whom you may say, if ’t please you, Fleance killed,
 For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
 Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
 It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
 To kill their gracious father? Damnèd fact,
 How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight
 In pious rage the two delinquents tear
 That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
 Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely, too,
 For ’twould have angered any heart alive
 To hear the men deny ’t. So that I say
 He has borne all things well. And I do think
 That had he Duncan’s sons under his key
 (As, an ’t please heaven, he shall not) they should
 find
 What ’twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.FTLN 1418

They exit. But peace. For from broad words, and ’cause he
 failed
 His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear
 Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
 Where he bestows himself?
   The son of Duncan
 (From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth)
 Lives in the English court and is received
 Of the most pious Edward with such grace
 That the malevolence of fortune nothing
 Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
 Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
 To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
 That, by the help of these (with Him above
 To ratify the work), we may again
 Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
 Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
 Do faithful homage, and receive free honors,
 All which we pine for now. And this report
 Hath so exasperate the King that he
 Prepares for some attempt of war.
  Sent he to Macduff?
 
 He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”
 The cloudy messenger turns me his back
 And hums, as who should say “You’ll rue the time
 That clogs me with this answer.”
   And that well might
 Advise him to a caution t’ hold what distance
 His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
 Fly to the court of England and unfold
 His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
 May soon return to this our suffering country
 Under a hand accursed.
  I’ll send my prayers with him.FTLN 1445

 Seize upon Fife, give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword

 What had he done to make him fly the land?
 
 You must have patience, madam.
   He had none.
 His flight was madness. When our actions do not,
 Our fears do make us traitors.
   You know not
 Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
 
 Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
 His mansion and his titles in a place
 From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
 He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
 The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
 Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
 All is the fear, and nothing is the love,
 As little is the wisdom, where the flight
 So runs against all reason.
   My dearest coz,
 I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,
 He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
 The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much
 further;
 But cruel are the times when we are traitors
 And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
 From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
 But float upon a wild and violent sea
 Each way and move—I take my leave of you.
 Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.
 Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
 To what they were before.—My pretty cousin,
 Blessing upon you.Scene 2

 A good and virtuous nature may recoil
 In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your

 That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
 Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
 Though all things foul would wear the brows of
 grace,
 Yet grace must still look so.

 Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
 Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
 Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
 Without leave-taking? I pray you,
 Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,
 But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
 Whatever I shall think.
   Bleed, bleed, poor country!
 Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
 For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy
 wrongs;
 The title is affeered.—Fare thee well, lord.
 I would not be the villain that thou think’st
 For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,
 And the rich East to boot.

MACDUFF There would be hands uplifted in my right;
 And here from gracious England have I offer
 Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,
 When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head
 Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
 Shall have more vices than it had before,
 More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
 By him that shall succeed.
   What should he be?
 
 It is myself I mean, in whom I know
 All the particulars of vice so grafted
 That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth
 Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
 Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
 With my confineless harms.
   Not in the legions
 Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned
 In evils to top Macbeth.
   I grant him bloody,
 Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
 Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
 That has a name. But there’s no bottom, none,
 In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,
 Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
 The cistern of my lust, and my desire
 All continent impediments would o’erbear
 That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth
 Than such an one to reign.
   Boundless intemperance
 In nature is a tyranny. It hath been
 Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne
 And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
 To take upon you what is yours. You may
 Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
 And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.FTLN 1805

MACDUFF We have willing dames enough. There cannot be
 That vulture in you to devour so many
 As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
 Finding it so inclined.
   With this there grows
 In my most ill-composed affection such
 A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
 I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
 Desire his jewels, and this other’s house;
 And my more-having would be as a sauce
 To make me hunger more, that I should forge
 Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
 Destroying them for wealth.
   This avarice
 Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
 Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
 The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear.
 Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
 Of your mere own. All these are portable,
 With other graces weighed.
 
 But I have none. The king-becoming graces,
 As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,
 Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
 Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
 I have no relish of them but abound
 In the division of each several crime,
 Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
 Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
 Uproar the universal peace, confound
 All unity on earth.

 With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,
 When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
 Since that the truest issue of thy throne
 By his own interdiction stands accursed
 And does blaspheme his breed?—Thy royal father
 Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,
 Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,
 Died every day she lived. Fare thee well.
 These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
 Hath banished me from Scotland.—O my breast,
 Thy hope ends here!
   Macduff, this noble passion,
 Child of integrity, hath from my soul
 Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
 To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth
 By many of these trains hath sought to win me
 Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
 From overcredulous haste. But God above
 Deal between thee and me, for even now
 I put myself to thy direction and
 Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
 The taints and blames I laid upon myself
 For strangers to my nature. I am yet
 Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
 Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
 At no time broke my faith, would not betray
 The devil to his fellow, and delight
 No less in truth than life. My first false speaking
 Was this upon myself. What I am truly
 Is thine and my poor country’s to command—
 Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
 Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,
 Already at a point, was setting forth.

 The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
 Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
 Put on with holy prayers; and, ’tis spoken,
 To the succeeding royalty he leaves
 The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
 He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
 And sundry blessings hang about his throne
 That speak him full of grace.

 Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot

 But who knows nothing is once seen to smile;
 Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air

 Expire before the flowers in their caps,

MALCOLM Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor
 Of many worthy fellows that were out;
 Which was to my belief witnessed the rather
 For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.
 Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland
 Would create soldiers, make our women fight
 To doff their dire distresses.
   Be ’t their comfort
 We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
 Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
 An older and a better soldier none
 That Christendom gives out.
   Would I could answer
 This comfort with the like. But I have words
 That would be howled out in the desert air,
 Where hearing should not latch them.
   What concern
 they—
 The general cause, or is it a fee-grief
 Due to some single breast?
   No mind that’s honest
 But in it shares some woe, though the main part
 Pertains to you alone.
   If it be mine,
 Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.
 
 Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
 Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
 That ever yet they heard.
   Hum! I guess at it.
 
 Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes
 Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner
 Were on the quarry of these murdered deer
 To add the death of you.

 Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
 Whispers the o’erfraught heart and bids it break.

 Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.
 
 And I must be from thence? My wife killed too?

  Be comforted.
 Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge
 To cure this deadly grief.
 
 He has no children. All my pretty ones?
 Did you say “all”? O hell-kite! All?
 What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
 At one fell swoop?
  Dispute it like a man.
  I shall do so,
 But I must also feel it as a man.
 I cannot but remember such things were
 That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on
 And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
 They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,
 Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
 Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.
 
 Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
 Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart; enrage it.
 
 O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
 And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
 Cut short all intermission! Front to front
 Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.

  I have two nights watched with you but can
 perceive no truth in your report. When was it she
 last walked?
  Since his Majesty went into the field, I
 have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown
 upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,
 fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and
 again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast
 sleep.
  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at
 once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
 watching. In this slumb’ry agitation, besides her
 walking and other actual performances, what at any
 time have you heard her say?
  That, sir, which I will not report after
 her.
  You may to me, and ’tis most meet you

  Why, it stood by her. She has light by
 her continually. ’Tis her command.
  You see her eyes are open.
  Ay, but their sense are shut.
  What is it she does now? Look how she rubs
 her hands.
  It is an accustomed action with her to
 seem thus washing her hands. I have known her
 continue in this a quarter of an hour.
  Yet here’s a spot.
  Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes
 from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more
 strongly.
  Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two.
 Why then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my
 lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear
 who knows it, when none can call our power to
 account? Yet who would have thought the old man
 to have had so much blood in him?
  Do you mark that?
  The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is
 she now? What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No
 more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that. You mar all
 with this starting.
  Go to, go to. You have known what you should
 not.
  She has spoke what she should not,
 I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has
 known.
  Here’s the smell of the blood still. All
 the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little

 charged.

Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, and
their army, with boughs.
 
 Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down
 And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,
 Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
 Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
 Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do,
 According to our order.
   Fare you well.
 Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,
 Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
 
 Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
 Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
Enter Macbeth.
 
 They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,
 But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What’s he
 That was not born of woman? Such a one
 Am I to fear, or none.
Enter young Siward.

He exits. Alarums.
SIWARD  Thou ’lt be afraid to hear it.
 
 No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name
 Than any is in hell.
   My name’s Macbeth.
 
 The devil himself could not pronounce a title
 More hateful to mine ear.
   No, nor more fearful.
 
 Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant. With my sword
 I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.
   Thou wast born of
 woman.
 But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
 Brandished by man that’s of a woman born.
Alarums. Enter Macduff.
 
 That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
 If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,
 My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.
 I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
 Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,
 Or else my sword with an unbattered edge
 I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
 By this great clatter, one of greatest note
 Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune,
 And more I beg not. 
Enter Malcolm and Siward.
 
 This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered.

MACDUFF The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
 The day almost itself professes yours,
 And little is to do.
   We have met with foes
 That strike beside us.
   Enter, sir, the castle.
Enter Macbeth.
 
 Why should I play the Roman fool and die
 On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes
 Do better upon them.
Enter Macduff.
   Turn, hellhound, turn!
 
 Of all men else I have avoided thee.
 But get thee back. My soul is too much charged
 With blood of thine already.
   I have no words;
 My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
 Than terms can give thee out. 
   Thou losest labor.
 As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
 With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
 Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
 I bear a charmèd life, which must not yield
 To one of woman born.
   Despair thy charm,
 And let the angel whom thou still hast served
 Tell thee Macduff was from his mother’s womb
 Untimely ripped.FTLN 2360

 Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so,
 For it hath cowed my better part of man!
 And be these juggling fiends no more believed
 That palter with us in a double sense,
 That keep the word of promise to our ear
 And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee.
  Then yield thee, coward,
 And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.
 We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
 Painted upon a pole, and underwrit
 “Here may you see the tyrant.”
   I will not yield
 To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet
 And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
 Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
 And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
 Yet I will try the last. Before my body
 I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
 And damned be him that first cries “Hold! Enough!”
They enter fighting, and Macbeth is slain. Macduff
exits carrying off Macbeth’s body. Retreat and flourish.
Enter, with Drum and Colors, Malcolm, Siward, Ross,
Thanes, and Soldiers.
 
 I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
 
 Some must go off; and yet by these I see
 So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
 In the unshrinking station where he fought,
 But like a man he died.
   Then he is dead?
 
 Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
 Must not be measured by his worth, for then
 It hath no end.
   Had he his hurts before?
 
 Ay, on the front.
   Why then, God’s soldier be he!
 Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
 I would not wish them to a fairer death;
 And so his knell is knolled.
 
 He’s worth more sorrow, and that I’ll spend for
 him.
  He’s worth no more.
 They say he parted well and paid his score,
 And so, God be with him. Here comes newer
 comfort.
Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head.
 
 Hail, King! for so thou art. Behold where stands
 Th’ usurper’s cursèd head. The time is free.
 I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl,
 That speak my salutation in their minds,
 Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.
 Hail, King of Scotland!

 In such an honor named. What’s more to do,

 As calling home our exiled friends abroad
 That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
 Producing forth the cruel ministers
 Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
 (Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands,
 Took off her life)—this, and what needful else
 That calls upon us, by the grace of grace,
 We will perform in measure, time, and place.
